        <p>
          BCI development is still a custom science project. Not repeatable engineering.
          Every team builds bespoke infrastructure from scratch, losing months to problems
          that should have been solved once.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the problem Vestral Labs exists to solve.
        </p>

        <h2>The pattern I kept seeing</h2>

        <p>
          Researchers optimize algorithms in isolation. Each team develops sophisticated
          signal processing, decoder architectures, and evaluation methods. Brilliant work
          happens in labs around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          But none of it transfers. There's no shared performance ground truth. A "90% accuracy"
          claim from Lab A can't be compared to a "92% accuracy" claim from Lab B, because they
          used different datasets, different preprocessing, different evaluation schemes,
          and different hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
          I call this <strong>unrequited specialization</strong>: deep expertise that can't
          compound because there's no common substrate to build on.
        </p>

        <h2>What other fields have</h2>

        <p>
          Chip design has SPICE. Machine learning has MLPerf. Web development has Lighthouse.
          Even video games have standardized benchmarks that let you compare GPUs meaningfully.
        </p>

        <p>
          These aren't just nice-to-haves. They're what turned those fields from artisanal
          craft into repeatable engineering. When you can measure things consistently,
          you can optimize systematically. When results are comparable, progress compounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          BCI doesn't have this yet. And it needs to.
        </p>

        <h2>What we're building</h2>

        <p>
          Vestral Labs is a BCI industry accelerator—a lab + product engine building
          the missing infrastructure layer:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Benchmarking</strong>: CORTEX, a reproducible framework for evaluating BCI algorithms across real hardware</li>
          <li><strong>Safety standards</strong>: Safety envelopes, validation primitives, signal quality thresholds</li>
          <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Common schemas so devices and software can actually work together</li>
          <li><strong>Deployment tooling</strong>: End-to-end latency measurement for distributed systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We're not building a headset. We're not building an implant. We're building
          the factory that makes many BCIs possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Why now</h2>

        <p>
          The BCI industry is at an inflection point. Investment is flowing in.
          Multiple companies are approaching clinical viability. The technology is maturing.
        </p>

        <p>
          But without infrastructure, the industry will fragment into incompatible silos—
          like early mobile platforms, but with devices in people's brains.
          That's not acceptable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Someone needs to build the boring stuff that enables everything else.
          That's us.
        </p>

        <h2>The long game</h2>

        <p>
          Infrastructure credibility is earned, not declared. We're not trying to
          ship a platform next month and declare victory. We're building for the long term.
        </p>

        <p>
          Phase 1 is benchmarking credibility. Prove CORTEX works. Get results that
          researchers trust. Build slowly, build right.
        </p>

        <p>
          Phase 2 is networked measurement. Phase 3 is ecosystem gravity. Phase 4 is
          something called Project Shelob—but that's a story for later.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, we're focused on the foundation.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "If you can't measure it honestly, you can't engineer it."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          That's the principle. That's why Vestral Labs exists.
        </p>
