        <p>
          Here's a finding that should alarm anyone working on BCI algorithms:
          we measured 49% performance variation attributable to platform effects alone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not algorithm quality. Not neural signal differences. Just platform inconsistency.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p class="callout__title">The Idle Paradox</p>
          <p class="callout__text">
            The same algorithm, running on the same data, produces substantially different
            results depending on which platform runs it—even when both platforms are "idle"
            and should be identical.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What we measured</h2>

        <p>
          We ran identical BCI decoding pipelines across multiple hardware platforms,
          controlling for as many variables as we could. Same datasets. Same preprocessing.
          Same model weights. Same evaluation scheme.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results varied by up to 49% depending on the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          This wasn't due to obvious factors like CPU vs GPU differences. The variation
          showed up even between nominally identical systems. Subtle differences in
          timing, memory management, floating-point handling, and background processes
          compound into significant performance deltas.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>

        <p>
          If platform effects account for half of your performance variation, then
          half of every "improvement" you claim might just be noise. And half of
          every comparison between algorithms is potentially meaningless.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the core problem with BCI benchmarking today: without controlling
          for platform effects, we can't distinguish real algorithmic improvements
          from platform artifacts.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Lab A reports 92% accuracy and Lab B reports 90% accuracy, we have
          no idea whether A's algorithm is better or whether A just got lucky with
          their platform configuration.
        </p>

        <h2>What this implies for benchmarking</h2>

        <p>
          Any serious benchmarking framework needs to:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Measure platform effects explicitly</strong>: Run calibration benchmarks that quantify how much the platform itself contributes to variation</li>
          <li><strong>Report platform-adjusted results</strong>: Normalize for platform effects so algorithmic improvements can be isolated</li>
          <li><strong>Require reproducibility</strong>: Results should be reproducible across platforms, not just on the original platform</li>
          <li><strong>Document environment exhaustively</strong>: Every aspect of the runtime environment that could affect results needs to be captured</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This is harder than it sounds. Platform effects are subtle and interact
          in complex ways. But it's necessary if we want benchmarking results
          that actually mean something.
        </p>

        <h2>How CORTEX addresses this</h2>

        <p>
          CORTEX is designed from the ground up to handle platform effects:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Telemetry discipline</strong>: Precise timing, resource utilization, and performance metrics at every stage</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-device adapters</strong>: Abstract away hardware differences while still measuring their impact</li>
          <li><strong>Calibration runs</strong>: Standard workloads that establish platform baselines</li>
          <li><strong>Artifact pipelines</strong>: Complete environment capture for every run</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The goal isn't to eliminate platform effects—that's impossible. The goal
          is to measure them, report them, and account for them in the final results.
        </p>

        <h2>The implication for the field</h2>

        <p>
          Every published BCI result that doesn't control for platform effects is
          potentially suspect. Not necessarily wrong—but uncertain in ways the
          authors may not realize.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't an indictment of the researchers doing this work. They're working
          with the tools available. But the tools need to get better.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what we're building.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "If you can't measure it honestly, you can't engineer it."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The Idle Paradox shows us just how far we have to go before we can
          measure BCI performance honestly. It's a long road, but at least now
          we know the destination.
